## Natural Sciences - Grade 4

Our Grade 4 Natural Sciences program encourages learners to explore the world around them through scientific inquiry. Students develop critical thinking skills while investigating natural phenomena and conducting hands-on experiments.

### Knowledge Areas

#### Life and Living
- Animal and plant life cycles
- Habitats and ecosystems
- Human body systems
- Interdependence in nature

#### Matter and Materials
- Properties of materials
- States of matter
- Changes in materials
- Uses of different materials

#### Energy and Change
- Sources of energy
- Heat and temperature
- Sound and light
- Simple machines

#### Earth and Beyond
- Weather patterns
- Day and night cycles
- Seasons and climate
- Natural resources

### Scientific Skills Development

Students learn to:
- **Observe**: Use all senses to gather information
- **Question**: Ask scientific questions about observations
- **Investigate**: Plan and conduct simple experiments
- **Record**: Document findings through drawings and writing
- **Communicate**: Share results and conclusions

### Practical Investigations

Hands-on activities include:
- Growing plants and observing life cycles
- Testing properties of different materials
- Investigating heat transfer
- Exploring sound and light phenomena
- Weather monitoring and recording

### Assessment and Evaluation

Learners are assessed through:
- **Formal Assessment (75%)**:
  - Tests and examinations
  - Practical investigations
  - Projects and assignments
- **Informal Assessment (25%)**:
  - Classwork and homework
  - Participation in discussions
  - Scientific drawings and observations

### Safety in Science

Safety is paramount in all scientific activities. Students learn proper handling of materials and equipment while developing responsible attitudes towards scientific investigation.
