## Mathematics Grade 2

Grade 2 Mathematics builds on the foundation established in Grade 1, expanding number concepts, introducing new operations, and developing problem-solving skills through practical applications.

### Learning Areas

**Numbers, Operations and Relationships**
- **Number concept**: Count, read, write, and order numbers to 100
- **Addition and subtraction**: Mental and written strategies for numbers to 50
- **Multiplication**: Grouping and repeated addition
- **Division**: Sharing and grouping equally
- **Fractions**: Halves and quarters of objects and shapes
- **Number patterns**: Counting in 2s, 5s, and 10s

**Patterns, Functions and Algebra**
- Geometric patterns using shapes and colors
- Number patterns and sequences
- Input and output relationships
- Simple algebraic thinking through patterns

**Space and Shape (Geometry)**
- **2D shapes**: Properties of triangles, squares, rectangles, circles
- **3D objects**: Cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, pyramids
- **Position and movement**: Directions, turns, and positions
- **Symmetry**: Lines of symmetry in shapes and patterns

**Measurement**
- **Length**: Using rulers and measuring tapes
- **Mass**: Comparing and measuring using scales
- **Capacity**: Measuring liquids using standard containers
- **Time**: Reading analog and digital clocks, calendar work
- **Money**: Coin recognition and simple transactions

**Data Handling**
- Collecting data through surveys and observations
- Organizing data in tables and charts
- Creating and reading pictographs and bar graphs
- Interpreting data to answer questions

### Key Mathematical Skills
