## Mathematics Grade R

Mathematics in Grade R provides the foundation for all future mathematical learning. Through play-based activities and hands-on experiences, learners develop number sense, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills.

### Key Learning Areas

**Numbers, Operations and Relationships**
- Counting from 1 to 10
- Number recognition and formation
- More and less concepts
- Simple addition and subtraction through practical activities

**Patterns, Functions and Algebra**
- Creating and continuing patterns using objects, sounds, and movements
- Sorting and classifying objects
- Understanding relationships between objects

**Space and Shape (Geometry)**
- Recognizing and naming basic 2D shapes
- Understanding positional vocabulary
- Building with blocks and shapes
- Exploring symmetry through art and play

**Measurement**
- Comparing sizes, lengths, and weights
- Understanding time concepts (day/night, before/after)
- Using non-standard units for measurement

**Data Handling**
- Simple data collection through surveys
- Creating pictographs with real objects
- Interpreting simple charts and graphs

### Teaching Approach

Mathematics in Grade R is taught through:
- **Play-based learning**: Using games and activities to explore mathematical concepts
- **Hands-on experiences**: Manipulating objects to understand abstract concepts
- **Story-telling**: Using mathematical stories and rhymes
- **Art integration**: Creating patterns and shapes through creative activities
- **Real-world connections**: Linking mathematics to everyday experiences
