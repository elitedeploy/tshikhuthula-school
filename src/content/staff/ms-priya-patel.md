### Personal Message

"We live in an incredible time where technology is transforming every aspect of our lives. The students I teach today will be the innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders who shape our digital future. My role is to give them the skills, confidence, and ethical foundation they need to use technology as a force for good.

I believe every student can learn to code, create, and innovate with technology. It's not about being naturally 'tech-savvy' â€“ it's about curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to learn from mistakes. Some of my most successful students started with no programming experience but had the determination to keep trying.

The technology field needs diverse voices and perspectives. I'm particularly passionate about encouraging girls and underrepresented groups to pursue technology careers. The problems we face as a society require diverse teams with different backgrounds and viewpoints.

My classroom is a place where students can experiment, fail safely, learn from mistakes, and celebrate successes. Whether you want to build the next great app, solve climate change with technology, or simply understand how the digital world works, I'm here to support your journey.

The future belongs to those who can think computationally, solve problems creatively, and use technology ethically. Let's build that future together."
