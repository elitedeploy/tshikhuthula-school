### Personal Message

"Science has the power to change the world, and I believe that every student has the potential to be part of that change. Whether they become doctors, engineers, environmental scientists, or simply informed citizens who make evidence-based decisions, the scientific thinking skills we develop together will serve them throughout their lives.

I am committed to creating a learning environment where students feel safe to ask questions, make mistakes, learn from failures, and celebrate discoveries. Science is about wonder, curiosity, and the joy of understanding how things work. My goal is to nurture that natural curiosity and help students develop the skills and confidence to tackle the scientific challenges of the future.

The laboratory door is always open for students who want to explore, experiment, or simply discuss the fascinating world of science. Together, we can discover, learn, and make a positive impact on our world."
